           <h2>Why this study choice?</h2>

      <p>Ever since I was little I have wanted to study abroad, fascinated by the beauty of the Netherlands and how good the people are. It got me interested in searching for a university here.<br> I started by going to an exposition about different universities. Hz really caught my eye but it turned out that they didn't have an ICT program in English. A few years went by and I got myself into one of the open days at Hz. At that moment I just knew that this was the place for me by how you applied your studies and got to do so many real world projects and assignments. When I met the people then I understood that the environment was the best option for me too. I saw my future career starting here and all the connections I was going to make here. Those things motivate me. After 4 years I think I’m going to get not only the knowledge I need, but also experiences and friends that will last a lifetime, and maybe even a job. My goal is to become a Web Developer and by choosing this program I think I’m on the right path to achieving that goal. </p>

    <h3>Personality analysis</h3>
<p class="swot">My strength is that I'm a very organized person. I like to plan out my week to know what I have to do and not to forget something important. I’m also a very optimistic person, and when I set my mind to something I do it no matter what. But on the flip side, when I get to planned out  or overwork myself, I feel lost. One of my weaknesses is that sometimes I get too much in my head doing stuff or multitasking. But there’s always something good in the bad things, when I overwork myself I usually do something to get my mind off of it like running or reading which is good for your well-being. The threat that I have to face on my journey is that I get distracted easily, because I have too many thoughts in my head.</p>

        <br>
        <br>
        Not counting my programming experience as a very young gamer. My journey began in high school when I applied to a school with an ICT program. Where we learned how to use Microsoft Excel, Powerpoint and Word. We also learned how to code with CSS, HTML and, C#. I worked on a lot of homework on these subjects.Then right in the beginning of 8th grade I joined a robotics club where one of the projects was to build a lego robot and code it to move to a line. We even had a coding week almost twice a year. I even made a simple website for one of my assignments. I had finished a course about Web development, requirements and a Photoshop course. This year I made a project in which we didn't finish a short animation clip.</p>

        <br>
        <br>
        My feedback very much helped me get to know myself better. Who I am as a person . But my opportunities were kinda the same as my strength and I had to put more information about me on the SKC document. I learned that sometimes I have to go with the flow, and not stress all the time about organizing.</p>

         <p class="b5"><bold style="font-size: 30px; width: 20px;height: 20px;font-family: 'Alfa Slab One',cursive;">Just why?</bold>
          <br>
          <br>
          IT the thing you heard me talk about in this blog a lot. Most of my childhood I was on a computer playing games you know like a normal girl. Because of that I started to think how I can make that game or how I could improve this website, also I am a very creative person and I randomly come up with solutions that could make peoples life more easier or help them. IT is the future and I want to be part of it. I find it fascinating how technologies improve every year, how they work and what you could do with just technologies these days and they are everywhere. My dream job was to become a web designer beacuse I know I like IT and I'm very creative person, but then I learned about web development and I found out that is not only about designing the websites, it's about bulding and maintaining the whole aspect of the websites it's more complicated than just design and creativeness.This job is much harder and I like that tought and I just want to prove myself as a woman that I could be a web developer and be in the IT field.</p>
